Secure Password Manager with GUI

 Overview:
The Secure Password Manager is a desktop application designed to help users securely store and manage their passwords. With the increasing number of online accounts and the need for strong, unique passwords, managing passwords manually can be challenging and insecure. This application addresses this issue by providing a user-friendly interface to add, retrieve, and manage passwords securely.

 Features:
1. User-Friendly Interface:
   - The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the `tkinter` library, making it easy for users to interact with the application.

2. Secure Storage:
   - Passwords are stored in an encrypted format using the `cryptography` library, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain secure.

3. Database Management:
   - The application uses an SQLite database to store the encrypted passwords along with the corresponding website and username.

4. Add and Retrieve Passwords:
   - Users can add new passwords by entering the website, username, and password. The application encrypts the password before storing it in the database.
   - Users can retrieve stored passwords by entering the website. The application decrypts the password and displays it along with the username.

5. Encryption and Decryption:
   - The application uses the Fernet symmetric encryption method from the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt passwords. This ensures that passwords are stored securely and can only be accessed by the user.

 Technical Details:
1. Libraries Used:
   - `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface.
   - `sqlite3`: For managing the database to store passwords.
   - `cryptography`: For encrypting and decrypting passwords.

2. Encryption Key Management:
   - The encryption key is generated using the `cryptography` library and stored securely. In a real-world application, additional measures should be taken to protect the encryption key.

3. Database Schema:
   - The database contains a single table `passwords` with columns for `id`, `website`, `username`, and `password`. The `password` column stores the encrypted password.

 How to Use:
1. Adding a Password:
   - Enter the website, username, and password in the respective fields.
   - Click the "Add Password" button to store the password securely in the database.

2. Retrieving a Password:
   - Enter the website in the respective field.
   - Click the "Retrieve Password" button to retrieve and display the stored username and decrypted password.

 Security Considerations:
- Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm to ensure they are stored securely.
- Key Management: The encryption key is generated and stored securely. In a production environment, additional security measures should be implemented to protect the encryption key.
- Database Security: The SQLite database is stored locally on the user's device. Additional security measures, such as database encryption, can be implemented for enhanced security.

 Future Enhancements:
- Password Generation: Add a feature to generate strong, random passwords for users.
- Password Strength Checker: Include a password strength checker to ensure users create strong passwords.
- Export/Import: Allow users to export and import their passwords securely.
